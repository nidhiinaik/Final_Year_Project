# Analysis of Women Safety using Twitter Data
Our project delves into the prevalent issue of violence and harassment against
women in public places across various cities in India. It focuses on the role of social
media, specifically Twitter in promoting the safety of women in Indian cities. It aims
to analyze womenâ€™s safety by leveraging twitter data and applying machine learning
techniques. This project applies TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis
algorithms to Twitter data to study public sentiment regarding women's safety,
offering insights to inform policy and highlight the efficacy of different sentiment
analysis tools. The project emphasizes the importance of developing a sense of
responsibility among Indian society to prioritize the safety of women in their
surroundings, through analyzing tweets on Twitter, which often contain images, text,
messages, and quotes regarding women's safety in Indian cities. The youth culture
can be educated to take strict action against those who harass women. Twitter and
other social media platforms, including hash tag messages, serve as a platform for
women to express their thoughts and experiences while traveling for work or using
public transport. This aims to shed light on the current state of mind of women when
they are surrounded by unknown men/women and whether they feel safe or not.
